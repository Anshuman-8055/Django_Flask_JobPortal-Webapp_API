# Django and Flask API Project

This project combines a Django web application for the user interface and a Flask API for backend data services.

## Overview

The Django application provides the front-end for users to interact with the system. The Flask API handles data processing, storage, and provides endpoints for the Django application (and potentially other clients) to consume. This architecture allows for a clear separation of concerns, making the application more maintainable and scalable.

## Technologies Used

* **Django:** A high-level Python web framework for building complex web applications.
* **Flask:** A lightweight Python microframework for building web APIs.
* **Python:** The programming language used for both frameworks.
* **[Add any other relevant technologies here, e.g., Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite), ORM, Deployment tools, etc.]**

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system.
* pip (Python package installer) installed.

### Setting up the Django Application

1.  Navigate to the Django application directory (assuming it's named `django_app`):
    ```bash
    cd django_app
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the Django dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Make migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  Create a superuser (optional, but recommended for initial setup):
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

6.  Run the Django development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The Django application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### Setting up the Flask API

1.  Navigate to the Flask API directory (assuming it's named `flask_api`):
    ```bash
    cd ../flask_api
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the Flask API dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Run the Flask development server:
    ```bash
    python app.py  # Assuming your main Flask app file is named app.py
    ```
    The Flask API will likely be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (default Flask port).

## API Endpoints (Flask)

* **[List your Flask API endpoints here with their methods and descriptions. For example:]**
    * `/api/data` (GET): Retrieves a list of data items.
    * `/api/items/<item_id>` (GET): Retrieves details for a specific item.
    * `/api/items` (POST): Creates a new item.

## Usage

The Django application will provide the user interface to interact with the data served by the Flask API. Ensure both the Django development server and the Flask development server are running to use the full functionality of the application. The Django application will make HTTP requests to the Flask API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data.

## Further Development

* **[Add any planned future features or improvements here.]**
* Implement user authentication and authorization for both the Django application and the Flask API.
* Set up a production deployment environment.
* Write unit and integration tests.
